The first panel shows a blonde figure on the left picking up a cellphone, and a phone surveyor in a suit with black hair on the right. The surveyor asks, 'what is your gender?' In the second panel, the blonde figure breaks the panel division, pushing their head into the face of the dismayed surveyor, saying 'WELL LET ME TELL YOU.' The third panel shows the phone surveyor staring into the distance, sweating and panicked. Around his figure are multiple speech bubbles from the blonde character, trailing off into a variety of explanations regarding their gender identity. In the last panel, the blonde character is leaning back in their chair with a satisfied expression, saying 'does that about answer it?' while the phone surveyor cries and chugs alcohol on the right of the panel."><img src="css/images/aq1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A four-panel vertical comic titled 'Are you a boy, or a girl?' drawn in black ink.
