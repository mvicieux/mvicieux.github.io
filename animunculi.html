<p>Bits, and bobbles, and bodies- oh my! Join us in the revelry of Animunculi, a multi-media cartoon installation exploring the euphoria of queer identiy. Transforming my avatar across sculpture, textile, and moving image, this body exudes motion, momentum, and metamorphosis. With the joy of body modification more prevalent and accessible than ever before, this work asks, what is so monstrous about transition? Entering this installation, I urge viewers to let go of ideas about what a body should be, and consider the joy of possibility embodied in queer identity.</p><br>

        <br><p>Solo exhibition installed at <a href="https://www.blockfortcolumbus.com/events" target="_blank">Blockfort Gallery</a>. Columbus, OH (October 2022)</p><br>
