<a href="css/images/mittens.jpg" data-lightbox="image-1" data-alt="A sepia coloured comic, reading left to right, top to bottom in a Z pattern. The first panel shows a grey siamese cat sitting on its Mom, waking her up as she is frazzled. She has short dark hair with sideswept bangs and glasses. Next to the bed, there sits an alarm clock which reads 8AM. A dark brown snowshoe siamese looks up at the alarm clock from the floor. In the next panel we see Mom standing in front of their empty food bowls wearing a floral nightgown, as they both break the borders of the panel with their excited yelling for food. In the last panel of the top row, we see mom in the background working from home at a computer desk. In the foreground, the two cats sniff at each other's noses with elongated, curious expressions and bright blue eyes. In the margins of the panels, we see the two cats sitting, sleeping, and running, leading the viewer to the bottom left of the page. In this panel, the two cats are play-fighting in a Lion King reenactment, with Mom and Dad watching surprised in the background. Mom is wearing a grey shirt and jeans. Dad is a large bearded man with long hair and rectangular glasses, wearing a black shirt, dark pants, and sneakers. In the lower right panel we see Dad holding the grey siamese cat while sitting in a recliner watching television, patting the cat's back as the cat purrs in his lap. In the final panel, we see Mom and Dad asleep in bed, with the grey siamese sitting on both parents as the snowshoe siamese watches from the floor. The bedside clock now reads 1AM."><img src="css/images/mittens.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A sepia coloured comic, reading left to right, top to bottom in a Z pattern.
